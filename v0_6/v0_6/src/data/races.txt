Human:

  Humans tend to be hardworking and
  industrious, and learn new things
  quickly.
  The human race is the most versatile
  of all the species available to
  players.
  Humans advance quickly in levels and
  have equal abilities in all skills.

  Humans can also be of any class.
/Human:

Elf:

  Elves are especially good at using
  those skills which require a degree
  of finesse, such as stealth,
  sword-fighting and archery, but tend
  to be poor at using brute force and
  inelegant forms of combat. They find
  heavy armour uncomfortable, and make
  the finest, lightest armours to be found
  anywhere.
  Elves are particularly good at using
  elven weapons.

  Are good at using enchantments and air
  elemental magic and are poor at invoking
  the powers of earth and death

  They have slightly fewer HP and
  slightly more magic than humans, and advance
  in experience a bit more slowly.
/Elf

High Elf:

  High elves are advance in levels very
  slowly, requiring half again as much experience
  as do humans.
/High Elf:

Grey Elf:

  Grey elves also advance slowly, but not as slowly
  as high elves. They excel at using short and long
  swords and bows, but are poor at other fighting
  skills. They are excellent at all forms of magic
  except for necromancy.
/Grey Elf

Deep Elf:

  The deep elves are an elven race who long ago fled
  the overworld to live in darkness underground.
  There they developed their mental powers, evolving a
  natural gift for all forms of magic
  (including necromancy and earth magic),
  and adapted physically to their new environment,
  becoming shorter and weaker than other elves and
  losing all colouration. They are poor at
  hand-to-hand combat but excellent at fighting
  from a distance.
/Deep Elf

Sludge Elf:

  Sludge elves are a somewhat degenerate race
  of elves.

  They are mirror images of normal elves in some
  respects: they have no special proficiency
  with bows or swords (long or short), nor do
  they have any aptitude in the traditional areas
  of high  elven magic (enchantments, conjurations
  and divinations). On the other hand, they are
  superlative transmuters, and are comfortable
  dabbling in necromantic, poison
  and elemental magic. As fighters they are
  often more dangerous unarmed than armed.
  They advance in level slightly faster than
  their common brethren.
/Sludge Elf

Hill Dwarf:

  Dwarves are short, hardy people that love to fight.

  Their armour and weapons are very well-crafted
  and much more durable. Dwarves are particularly
  dangerous when using dwarven weaponry.

  Hill dwarves are extremely robust but are poor
  at using magic. They are excellent at hand
  combat, especially favouring axes or
  bludgeoning weapons, and are good at using
  armour and shields, but are poor at missile combat
  or at using polearms.

  The only forms of magic which they can use
  with even a minimal degree of aptitude are earth,
  fire and conjurations.

  They advance in levels as fast a common elves.
/Hill Dwarf

Mountain Dwarf:

  Mountain dwarves come from the larger, more
  civilised communities of the mountains. They
  advance slightly more quickly than hill dwarves
  and are almost as robust while having similar
  aptitudes, but are slightly worse at fighting
  while being slightly better at more civilised
  pursuits.
/Mountain Dwarf

Halfling:

  Halflings, who are named for being about half
  the size of a human, live in small villages.
  They live simple lives, and have simple
  interests. Some times a particularly restless
  halfling will leave his or her village in search
  of adventure.

  Halflings are very small and are among the least
  robust of any character species. Although only
  average at most fighting skills, they can use
  short blades well and are good at all forms of
  missile combat. They are also very stealthy and
  good at dodging and stabbing, but are poor
  at magic (except enchantments and, for some
  reason, translocations). They advance in levels
  as rapidly as humans. Halflings cannot
  wield large weapons.
/Halfling

Gnome:

  Gnomes are an underground-dwelling race of
  creatures, related to the dwarves but even
  more closely in touch with the earth.

  They are quite small, and share many of their
  characteristics with halflings
  (except for the great agility), although they
  advance slightly more slowly in experience levels.
  They are okay at most skills, but excellent at
  earth elemental magic and very poor at air magic.

  Occasionally they can use their empathy with the
  earth to sense their surroundings; this ability
  increases in power as they gain experience
  levels.
/Gnome

Hill Orc:

  Hill orcs are orcs from the upper world who,
  jealous of the riches which their cousins the
  cave orcs possess below the ground, descend in
  search of plunder and adventure.

  Hill orcs are as robust as the hill dwarves, but
  have  very low reserves of magical energy. Their
  forte is brute-force fighting, and they are skilled
  at using most hand weapons (with the exception of
  short blades, at which they are only fair), although
  they are not particularly good at using missile
  weapons. They prefer to use their own weapons.
  Orcs are poor at using most types of magic with the
  exception of conjurations, necromancy, and
  earth and fire elemental magic. They advance as
  quickly as humans.
/Hill Orc

Kobold:

  Kobolds are small, ugly creatures with few redeeming
  features. They are not the sort of people you would
  want to spend much time with, unless you happen to
  be a kobold yourself.

  They have poor abilities and have similar aptitudes
  to halflings, without the excellent agility.
  However, they are better than halflings at using
  some types of magic, particularly summonings and
  necromancy.

  They often live as scavengers, surviving on
  carrion, but are carnivorous and can only eat meat.
  They advance in levels as quickly as humans.
/Kobold


Mummy:

  Mummies are undead creatures naturally immune to
  poisons and negative energy, have little warmth
  left to be affected by cold, and are not susceptible
  to reductions in their physical or mental abilities.

  Mummies progress very slowly in level, half again
  as slow as humans, except fighting,
  spellcasting and necromancy. As they increase in
  level they become increasingly in touch with the
  powers of death, but cannot use some types of
  necromancy which only affect living creatures. The
  side effects of necromantic magic tend to be
  relatively harmless to mummies.

  However, their dessicated bodies are highly
  flammable. They also do not need to eat or drink,
  and in any case are incapable of doing so.
/Mummy

Ghoul:

  Ghouls are horrible undead creatures, slowly rotting
  away. They have little warmth left to be affected by
  cold, and are not susceptible to reductions in their
  physical or mental abilities.

  Although ghouls can sleep in their graves for
  years on end, when they rise to walk among the
  living they must eat flesh to survive. Raw flesh is
  preferred, especially rotting or tainted meat, and
  ghouls gain strength from consuming it.

  They aren't very good at doing most things, although
  they make decent fighters and, due to their contact
  with the grave, can use ice, earth and death magic
  without too many difficulties.
/Ghoul

Naga:

  The Naga are a race of hybrids: humanoid from the
  waist up, with a large snake tail instead of legs.

  They are reasonably good at most things and advance
  in experience levels at a decent rate. They are
  naturally immune to poisons, can see invisible
  creatures, and have tough skin, but their tails are
  relatively slow and cannot move them around as
  quickly as can other creatures' legs (this only
  affects their movement rate; all other actions
  are at normal speed). Their body shape also prevents
  them from gaining full protection from most armour.

  Every now and then, a naga can spit poison; the
  range, accuracy and damage
  of this poison increases with the naga's
  experience level.
/Naga:

Ogres and Ogre Mages:

Ogre:

  Ogres are huge, chunky creatures related to orcs.
  They are terrible monsters who usually live to do
  nothing more than smash, smash, smash, and destroy.

  They have great physical strength, but are bad at
  almost everything except fighting and learn quite
  slowly. Because of their large size they can only
  wear loose robes, cloaks and animal skins.

  Although ogres can eat almost anything, their size
  means that they need to do so more frequently than
  smaller folk.
/Ogre

Ogre-Mage:

  Ogre-mages are a separate race of ogres who are 
  unique among the beefier species in their ability 
  to use magic, especially enchantments. Although
  slighter than their common ogre relatives they 
  nevertheless have great strength and can survive 
  a lot of punishment.

  They advance in level as slowly as high elves.
/Ogre

Troll:

  Trolls are like ogres, but even nastier. They have
  thick, knobbly skins of any colour from putrid green
  to mucky brown and their mouths are full of
  ichor-dripping fangs.

  They can rip creatures apart with their claws, and
  regenerate very quickly from even the most terrible
  wounds. They learn very slowly indeed - even  more
  slowly than high elves - and need a great amount
  of food to survive.
/Troll

Draconian:

  Draconians are a race of human-dragon hybrids:
  humanoidin form and approximately human-sized,
  with wings, tails and scaly skins.

  Draconians start out in an immature form with brown
  scales, but as they grow in power they take on a
  variety of colours.

  Some types of draconians have breath weapons.

  Draconians advance very slowly in level, but are
  reasonably good at all skills but armour
  (most types of which they cannot wear)
  and missile weapons.
/Draconian

Centaur:

  The Centaurs are another race of hybrid creatures:
  horses with a human torso. They usually live in
  forests, surviving by hunting.

  Centaurs can move very quickly on their four legs,
  and  are excellent with bows and other missile
  weapons; they are also reasonable at the Fighting
  skill while being slow learners at specific weapon
  skills.  They advance quite slowly in experience
  level and are rather sub-average at using magic.

  Due to their large bulk, they need a little extra
  food to survive.
/Centaur

Demigod:

  Demigods are mortals (humans, orcs or elves,
  for example) with some divine or angelic ancestry,
  however distant; they can be created by a number of
  processes including magical experiments and the
  time-honoured practice of interplanar miscegenation.

  Demigods look more or less like members of their
  mortal part's race, but  have excellent abilities
  (strength,int, dex) and are extremely robust; they
  can also draw on great supplies of magical energy.
  On the downside they advance very slowly in
  experience, gain skills slightly less quickly than
  humans, and  due to their status cannot worship
  the various Gods and Powersavailable to other
  classes of being.
/Demigod

Spriggan:

  Spriggans are small magical creatures distantly
  related to elves. They love to frolic and cast
  mischevious spells. They are poor fighters, have
  little physical resilience, and are terrible at
  destructive magic - conjurations, summonings,
  necromancy and elemental spells. On the other
  hand, they are excellent at other forms of magic
  and are very good at moving silently and quickly.
  So great is their speed that a spriggan can keep
  pace with a centaur.
/Spriggan

Minotaur:

  The minotaur is yet another hybrid - a human body
  with a bovine head. It delves into the Dungeon
  because of its instinctive love of twisting
  passageways.

  Minotaurs are extremely good at all forms of
  physical combat, but are awful at using any type
  of magic.

  They can wear all armour except for some headgear.
/Minotaur

Demonspawn:

  Demonspawn are horrible half-mortal, half-infernal
  creatures - the flip side of the Demigods.

  Demonspawn can be created in any number of ways:
  magical experiments, breeding, unholy pacts, etc.
  Although many demonspawn may be indistinguishable
  from those of pure mortal stock, they often grow
  horns, scales or other unusual features. Powerful
  members of this class of beings also develop a
  range of unholy abilities (mutations).

  Demonspawn advance quite slowly in experience and
  learn most skills at about the same rate as do
  Demigods. However, they are a little better at
  fighting and much better at conjurations,
  summonings, necromancy and invocations.
/Demonspawn

Kenku:

  The Kenku are an ancient and feared race of
  bird-people with a legendary propensity for
  violence. Basically  humanoid with bird-like
  heads and clawed feet, the kenku can wear all
  types of armour except helmets and boots.

  Powerful kenku can fly and very powerful members
  of this race can stay in the air for as long as
  they wish to do so.

  They are experts at all forms of fighting, including
  the magical arts of combat (conjurations, summonings
  and, to a lesser extent, necromancy). They are good
  at air and fire elemental magic, but poor at ice and
  earth magic.

  Kenku do not appreciate any form of servitude, and
  so are poor at using invocations. Their light avian
  bodies cannot sustain a great deal of injury.
/Kenku

Merfolk:

  The Merfolk are a hybrid race of half-human,
  half-fish. Their tails will quickly reform into
  legs once they leave the water.T hey tend to be
  surprising nimble on land as well as in the water.
  They can quickly slip out of any encumbering armour
  during the transformation into their half-fish form.

  The Merfolk have developed their martial arts
  on thrusting and grappling prefering polearms and
  short swords above all other weapons,although they
  can also use longer swords quite well.

  Their  mystical relationship with water makes it
  easier for them to use divination, poison, and
  ice magics...The instability of their own 
  morphogenic matrix has made them very accomplished
  transmuters, but most other magics seem foreign 
  to them.
/Merfolk
