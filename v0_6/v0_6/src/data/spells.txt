NM:Apportation
SC:256
LV:1
DC:This spell allows the caster to pull the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor near the caster.  The mass of the target item(s) will make the task more difficult, with some items too massive to ever be moved by this spell.

It renders living casters nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but can bring them dangerously close to death (how close depends on one's necromantic abilities). The spell can be cancelled at any time by any healing effect, and the caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. Undead cannot use this spell.

ID:110
NM:Twisted Resurrection

DC:This spell dramatically but temporarily increases the caster's recuperative abilities, while also increasing the rate of food consumption. 


ID:112
NM:Bone Shards
SC:32
LV:3
DC:This spell uses the bones of a skeleton (or similar materials: the rigid exoskeleton of an insect, for example) to dispense a lethal spray of slicing fragments, allowing its caster to dispense with conjurations in favour of necromancy alone to provide a low-level yet very powerful offensive spell. The use of a large and heavy skeleton (by wielding it) amplifies this spell's effect. 


ID:113
NM:Banishment
SC:256
LV:5
DC:This spell banishes one creature to the Abyss. Those wishing to visit that unpleasant place in person may always banish themselves.

ID:147
NM:Portal
SC:256
LV:8
DC:This spell creates a gate allowing long-distance travel in relatively ordinary environments (i.e., the Dungeon only). The portal lasts long enough for the caster and nearby creatures to enter. Casters are never taken past the level limits of the current area. 


ID:148
NM:Agony
SC:32
LV:5
DC:This spell cuts the resilience of a target creature in half, although it will never cause death directly. 


ID:149
NM:Spider Form
SC:528
LV:3
DC:This spell temporarily transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature.  Spellcasting is slightly more difficult in this form.  This spell is not powerful enough to allow the caster to slip out of cursed equipment.

ID:151
NM:Disintegrate

ID:152
NM:Blade Hands
SC:16

LV:9
DC:This spell raises living creatures slain by the caster into a state of unliving slavery as spectral horrors. 


ID:158
NM:Symbol of Torment
SC:32
LV:6
DC:This spell calls on the powers of Hell to cause agonising injury to any living thing in the caster's vicinity. It carries within itself a degree of danger, for any brave enough to invoke it, for the Symbol also affects its caller and indeed will not function if he or she is immune to its terrible effects. Despite its ominous power, this spell is never lethal. 


ID:159
NM:Deflect Missiles
SC:2050
LV:6
DC:This spell protects the caster from any kind of projectile attack, although particularly powerful attacks (lightning bolts, etc.) are deflected to a lesser extent than lighter missiles. 


ID:160
NM:Orb of Fragmentation

ID:161
NM:Ice Bolt
SC:9
LV:4
DC:This spell throws forth a chunk of ice. It is particularly effective against those creatures not immune to the effects of freezing, but the half of its destructive potential that comes from its weight and cutting edges cannot be ignored by even cold-resistant creatures. 


ID:162
NM:Ice Storm

LV:9
DC:This spell conjures forth a raging blizzard of ice, sleet and freezing gasses. 


ID:163

ID:165
NM:Shadow Creatures
SC:64
LV:5
DC:This spell weaves a creature from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter. The creature thus brought into existence will recreate some type of creature found in the caster's immediate vicinity. The spell even creates appropriate equipment for the creature, which are given a lasting substance by their firm contact with reality. 


ID:166
NM:Confusing Touch
SC:2
LV:1
DC:This spell enchants the casters hands with magical energy. This energy is released when the caster touches a monster with their bare hands, and may induce a state of confusing in the monster.

ID:169
NM:Passwall
SC:1040
LV:3
DC:This spell tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock. This can be dangerous, since it is possible for the spell to expire while the caster is en route, and it also takes time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which time they will be helpless. 


ID:170
NM:Ignite Poison
SC:20
LV:7
DC:This spell attempts to convert all poison within the caster's view into liquid flame. It is very effective against poisonous creatures or those carrying poison potions. It is also an amazingly painful way to eliminate poison from one's own system.

DC:This spell attempts to tame animals in the caster's vicinity. It works best on animals amenable to domestication. 


ID:175
NM:Ensorcled Hibernation
SC:10
LV:2
DC:This spell tries to lower its target's metabolic rate, inducing hypothermic hibernation. It may have side effects on cold-blooded creatures. 


ID:176
NM:Metabolic Englaciation
SC:10
LV:7
DC:This spell tries to lower the metabolic rate of every creature within the caster's view enough to induce hypothermic hibernation. It may have side effects on cold-blooded creatures. 


ID:177
NM:Detect Magic
SC:128
LV:1
DC:This spell apparently does not exist. Casting it may therefore be unwise. Please contact Dungeon Tech Support at /dev/null for details. 


ID:178
NM:Detect Secret Doors
SC:128
LV:1
DC:This spell is beloved by lazy dungeoneers everywhere, for it can greatly reduce time-consuming searches. 


ID:179
NM:See Invisible
SC:130
LV:4
DC:This spell enables the caster to perceive things that are shielded from ordinary sight. 


ID:180
NM:Forescry
SC:128
LV:5
DC:This spell makes the caster aware of the immediate future; while not far enough to predict the result of a fight, it does give the caster ample time to get out of the way of a punch (reflexes allowing). 


ID:181
NM:Summon Butterflies
SC:64
LV:1
DC:This spell creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!


ID:182
NM:Warp Weapon
SC:258
LV:7
DC:This spell temporarily binds a localized warp field to the invoker's weapon. This spell is very dangerous to cast, as the field is likely to effect the caster as well. 


ID:183
NM:Silence
SC:2050
LV:3
DC:This spell eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting spells, praying or yelling in the caster's vicinity impossible. (Applies to caster too, of course.)  This spell will not hide your presence, since its oppressive, unnatural effect will almost certainly alert any living creature that something is very wrong. 


ID:184
NM:Shatter
SC:1040
LV:9
DC:This spell causes a burst of concussive force around the caster, which will damage most creatures, although those composed of stone, metal or crystal, or otherwise brittle, will particularly suffer. The magic has been known to adversely affect walls. 


ID:185
NM:Dispersal
SC:256
LV:7
DC:This spell tries to teleport away any monsters directly beside the caster. 


ID:186
NM:Static Discharge
SC:2049
LV:4
DC:This spell releases electric charges against those next to the caster.  These may arc to adjacent monsters (or even the caster) before they eventually ground out. 


ID:187
NM:Bend
SC:256
LV:1
DC:This spell applies a localized spatial distortion to the detriment of some nearby creature. 


ID:188
NM:Corona
SC:2
LV:1
DC:This spell causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature. This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and thereby makes the affected creature appreciably easier to hit.


ID:189
NM:Alistair's Intoxication
SC:528
LV:4
DC:This spell works by converting a small portion of brain matter into alcohol. It affects all intelligent humanoids within the caster's view (presumably including the caster). It is frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties. 


ID:190
NM:Glamour
SC:2
LV:5
DC:This spell is an Elvish magic, which draws upon the viewing creature's credulity and the caster's comeliness to charm, confuse or render comatose. 


ID:191
NM:Evaporate
SC:20
LV:2
DC:This spell causes a potion held by the caster to evaporate, spreading the liquid's magical potency into surrounding air. 


ID:192
NM:Eringya's Surprising Bouquet
SC:1040
LV:4
DC:This spell apparently does not exist. Casting it may therefore be unwise. Please contact Dungeon Tech Support at /dev/null for details. 


ID:193
NM:Lee's Rapid Deconstruction
SC:1040
LV:5
DC:This spell creates a concussive explosion within a large body of rock (or other hard material), to the detriment of any who happen to be standing nearby. 


ID:194
NM:Air Walk
SC:2064
LV:9
DC:This spell transforms the caster's body into an insubstantial cloud. The caster becomes immaterial and nearly immune to physical harm, but is vulnerable to magical fire and ice. While insubstantial the caster is, of course, unable to interact with physical objects (but may still cast spells). 


ID:195
NM:Sandblast
SC:1040
LV:1
DC:This spell creates a short blast of high-velocity particles. It works best when the caster provides some source (by wielding a stone), but will do what it can with whatever ambient grit is available. 


ID:196
NM:Rotting
SC:48
LV:5
DC:This spell causes the flesh of all those near the caster to rot. It will affect the living and many of the corporeal undead. 


ID:197
NM:Shuggoth Seed
SC:96
LV:7
DC:This spell implants a shuggoth seed, the larval parasitic form of the fearsome shuggoth, in a living host. The shuggoth seed will draw life from its host and then hatch, whereupon a fully grown shuggoth will burst from the unfortunate host's chest. 


ID:198
NM:Maxwell's Silver Hammer
SC:1026
LV:2
DC:This spell bestows a lethal but temporary gravitic field to a crushing implement held by the caster. It will not affect weapons otherwise subject to special enchantments. 


ID:199
NM:Condensation Shield
SC:24
LV:4
DC:This spell causes a disc of dense vapour to condense out of the air surrounding the caster. It acts like a normal shield, but its density (and therefore stopping power) depends upon the caster's skill with Ice Magic. The disc is controlled by the caster's mind and thus will not conflict with the wielding of a two-handed weapon. 


ID:200
NM:Semi-Controlled Blink
SC:256
LV:3
DC:This spell apparently does not exist. Casting it may therefore be unwise. Please contact Dungeon Tech Support at /dev/null for details. 


ID:201
NM:Stoneskin
SC:1026
LV:2
DC:This spell hardens the one's skin to a degree determined by one's skill in Earth Magic. This enchantment only works on relatively normal flesh; it will aid neither the undead nor the bodily transformed.


ID:202
NM:Simulacrum
SC:40
LV:7
DC:This spell uses a piece of a flesh in hand to create a replica of the original being out of ice. This magic is unstable so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud, if it isn't hacked or melted into a small puddle of water first. 


ID:203
NM:Conjure Ball Lightning
SC:2049
LV:8
DC:This spell allows the conjurer to create ball lightning.  Using the spell is not without risk - ball lighting can be difficult to control. 


ID:10
NM:Far Strike
SC:256
LV:3
DC:This spell allows the caster to transfer the force of a weapon strike to any target the caster can see.  This spell will only deliver the impact of the blow; magical side-effects and enchantments cannot be transferred in this way.  The force transferred by this spell has little to do with one's skill with weapons, and more to do with personal strength, translocation skill, and magic ability. 


ID:11
NM:Delayed Fireball
SC:5
LV:7
DC:Successfully casting this spell gives the caster the ability to instantaneously release a fireball at a later time.  Knowing this spell allows the learner to memorise Fireball for no additional spell levels. 


ID:210
NM:nonexistent spell
SC:0
LV:0
DC:This spell apparently does not exist. Casting it may therefore be unwise. Please contact Dungeon Tech Support at /dev/null for details.
