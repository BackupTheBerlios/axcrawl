This is a small spoiler for Crawl 3.20; it indicates which gods like
or dislike which actions, in a small and compact form, for those
players, who aren't already familiar with the various deities. I've
also included some notes on the gifts the gods may grant and the
effects of high piety. All this is from the source; I hope I've read
the relevant parts correctly.

I hope some may find this useful. Additions and corrections are
welcome.

The gods:

1: Zin
2: The Shining One
3: Kikubaaqudgha
4: Yredelemnul
5: Xom
6: Vehumet
7: Okawaru
8: Makhleb
9: Sif Muna
A: Trog
B: Nemelex Xobeh
C: Elyvilon

+: may have positive effect on your piety;
-: may have negative effect on your piety.

Note that the effects are not cumulative; if you kill an angel in the
name of Elyvion, you will be punished only once, as far as I
understand the source.
