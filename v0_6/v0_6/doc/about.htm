<h1>Dungeon AX-Crawl</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
Dungeon Craw is a large and very random game of subterranean exploration in a fantasy 
world of magic and frequent violence. Your quest is to travel into the depths 
of the Dungeon (which is different each time you play) and retrieve the Orb of 
Zot which is guarded by many horrible and hideous creatures.
<p>
Dungeon Ax-Crawl is based in Dungeon Crawl and represents my own ideas and interests.

(introduction stolen from NetHack - http://www.nethack.org )
<pre>
          Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant
          in  your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting, steal-
          ing, crusading, and combat have haunted you  in  your  sleep  for
          many  months,  but  you  aren't  sure  of the reason.  You wonder
          whether you have in fact been having those dreams all your  life,
          and  somehow managed to forget about them until now.  Some nights
          you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollec-
          tion  of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be lurk-
          ing behind every corner of the  dungeon  in  your  dream.   Could
          these details haunting your dreams be real? As each night passes,
          you feel the desire to enter  the  mysterious  caverns  near  the
          ruins  grow stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly put the
          idea out of your head as you recall the tales of  those  who  en-
          tered  the caverns before you and did not return.  Eventually you
          can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place  in  your
          dreams  no  longer.  After  all, when other adventurers came back
          this way after spending time in the caverns, they usually  seemed
          better off than when they passed through the first time.  And who
          was to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept
          going?

<dt><b>Free and opensource</b>
<dd>I develop it for fun, not for make money. Also it's opensource.
    It means that you can get the source of the game and modify yourself.
    For details see the license

<dt><b>Roguelike game</b>
<dd>Rogue was a roll game very innovative in the moment it was created 
    because its  screen orientation  was  almost  unique  among  computer  fantasy games.
    Instead lots of descriptive texts, it used a 'graphical' interface,
    but instead graphics, it used letters.
    Unlike text adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English  
    sentences and explain the results in words, commands are all
    one or two keystrokes and the results are  displayed  'graphically'.
    It was the first of a class of games that are known as 'rogue-likes'.
    <p>
    Crawl is an RPG of the 'rogue-like' type, one of the descendants of Rogue. Its 
    graphics are simple but highly informative, designed to be understood at a 
    glance, and control is exercised largely through one-keystroke commands.  
    
     
<dt><b>Single player random dungeon simulation.</b>
<dd> A player may play with a character over a period of days, weeks, even months, 
     attempting to win the game by retrieving the Orb of Zot which is located 
     deep down in the Hell. <p>
     
     Dungeon Crawl generates a new dungeon every time you play it.
     This, with the fact that they are a lot of 
     races and jobs, each one truly different from the others, 
     makes each game a new adventure different from previous games.

<dt><b>Text based</b>
<dd>If you want a game stored in five CD-ROMs that
    justify the lot of money you spent in the last
    computer with the last 3D accelerator video card,
    this game isn't for you.
    <p>
    The game runs smootly in a pentium 100Mhz. It uses letters
    instead graphics. So a yellow 'o' is ann orc knight, a blue 'f'
    a fountain, a '"' and amulet, an so on. 
    <p>Letters forces you to use your imagination. After playing 
    a bit, there isn't any graphic that can terrorize you more than
    this red 'D' (a fire dragon)


<dt><b>The Crawl way and skill system</b>
<dd>The "Crawl Way" isn't to put limits on class: Class is really
"job before entering dungeon".  It only determines a starting
equipment and stats (essentially marking the availablity
of certain disciplines in particular cultures)...  what the
character becomes is entirely up to how they chose to play.
<p>
Crawl has a very detailed skill system.
Your character has a number of skills which affect his or her ability to
perform certain tasks. Some races can learn some skills faster that others . 
<p>
Each time your character gains experience points, those points become available to
increase skills. You convert experience points into skill levels by practising
the skill in question.
