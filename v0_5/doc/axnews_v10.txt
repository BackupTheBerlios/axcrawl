DUNGEON AX-CRAWL

v.01.00

$:CYAN:$About$:LIGHTGREY:$

I'm developping my own version of Crawl, Ax-Crawl, based in Dungeon Crawl 4.0.0 beta 20.

It's taking a lot of time and sometimes it seems impossible to finish.

While I finish, I'm planning to realease some bits of code, hopping someome find them helpful.
